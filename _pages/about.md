Hey! I am Subhodeep, a Ph.D. student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad. I'm working under the supervision of [Dr. Srijit Bhattacharjee](http://profile.iiita.ac.in/srijit/) and my broad area of interest is *gravitational and black hole physics* with an emphasis on the internal structure of black holes, quasinormal modes, gravitational lensing and black hole shadows. In simple terms, I use theoretical and computational tools to probe classical and quantum aspects of black holes and try to understand what they can say about the nature of reality. I am also interested in the prospect of doing fundamental physics with gravitational waves. To know more about my work, please check out my [publications page](/al-folio/publications/).

My interest in physics and mathematics are however wide-ranging; beyond my graduate research work, I am keenly interested in exploring dynamical systems and applications of machine learning techniques in physical sciences. I also take a lot of pleasure in teaching physics, mathematics and programming, and I am actively involved in assisting my supervisor in teaching a diverse range of subjects like numerical methods and computational physics, biostatistics, Python programming, and classical and quantum mechanics.

I also enjoy meeting and collaborating with new people. So, please feel free to get in touch if you would like to discuss and study some of the broad topics that I've mentioned!
